# Feature Specification: Rialo Bird Browser Game

**Feature Branch**: `001-title-rialo-bird`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A browser-based 2D game called Rialo Bird, inspired by Flappy Bird but fully rebranded with company identity. Players control a logo-bird character that navigates through vertical obstacle pipes themed with company brand colors and icons. Core loop is tap-to-flap, avoid obstacles, and earn points."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a player, I want to control a branded bird character through obstacle courses so that I can achieve high scores and compete with others while experiencing my company's brand identity in an engaging game format.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the game is loaded, **When** I tap/click/spacebar, **Then** the bird character flaps upward and gravity pulls it down
2. **Given** the bird is flying, **When** I avoid passing through pipe obstacles, **Then** my score increases by 1 point per pipe passed
3. **Given** the bird collides with a pipe or ground, **When** the collision occurs, **Then** the game ends and shows my final score
4. **Given** I'm playing the game, **When** I pause the game, **Then** the game state is preserved and can be resumed
5. **Given** I achieve a new high score, **When** the game ends, **Then** the high score is saved and displayed prominently

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the player rapidly taps multiple times in succession?
- How does the system handle when the bird gets stuck between pipes?
- What occurs if the game loses focus or the browser tab becomes inactive?
- How does the system respond to very slow or very fast device performance?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide tap-to-flap control mechanism (mouse click, touch tap, or spacebar)
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement gravity physics that continuously pulls the bird downward
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate vertical pipe obstacles with randomized gap positions
- **FR-004**: System MUST detect collisions between bird and pipes or ground, triggering game over
- **FR-005**: System MUST increment score by 1 point for each successfully passed obstacle
- **FR-006**: System MUST display live score on the game HUD during gameplay
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide game states: start screen, running game, pause, game over
- **FR-008**: System MUST show score summary screen after game over with option to restart
- **FR-009**: System MUST render bird sprite with animated flapping wings (128x128px base, scalable)
- **FR-010**: System MUST render pipe obstacles styled with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific company brand colors and logos]
- **FR-011**: System MUST display layered background with parallax effect and gradient sky
- **FR-012**: System MUST use transparent PNG format for all sprite assets
- **FR-013**: System MUST play looping background music in chiptune/electronic style
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide sound effects for flap, score, and collision events
- **FR-015**: System MUST implement minimalist, flat UI design using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific company typography and colors]
- **FR-016**: System MUST progressively increase difficulty over time (smaller gaps, faster movement)
- **FR-017**: System MUST maintain smooth 60 FPS gameplay performance
- **FR-018**: System MUST be playable on both desktop and mobile web browsers
- **FR-019**: System MUST keep total asset size under 2 MB for initial version
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide intuitive controls accessible via mouse, touch, or keyboard

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Player Score**: Represents current game session points, persists during gameplay, resets on new game
- **High Score**: Represents best achieved score, persists across game sessions, updates when exceeded
- **Game State**: Represents current phase (start, playing, paused, game over), controls UI and interactions
- **Bird Character**: Represents player-controlled entity with position, velocity, animation state
- **Pipe Obstacle**: Represents vertical barrier with gap, position, collision boundaries
- **Background Layer**: Represents visual environment with parallax movement, branding elements

---

## Future Extensions *(optional)*

### Planned Enhancements
- **Online Leaderboard**: Store player names and high scores using Supabase database
- **Seasonal Themes**: Holiday backgrounds and alternate pipe designs
- **Power-ups**: Shield protection, slow motion effect, double score multiplier
- **Lucky Pipes**: Special obstacles that grant bonus points when cleared
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Optional race mode for competitive play

### Clarifications Needed
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Exact company brand colors / hex codes for UI, pipes, and background]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which company logos/icons should be used for pipes and background patterns?]
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Preferred audio style reference (retro chiptune, lo-fi, or branded jingle)?]
